# Chalk Up

A web application for rock climbers who want to find others to climb with

When I first started out rock climbing, one of the hardest things was finding other people to rock climb with. This was especially applicable for top-roping and lead climbing, where another person is needed in order to climb. I remember having to reach out through facebook communities and instagram in order to potentially find people to climb with. I felt like it would be a nice quality of life change to create an app for like-minded rock climbers to meet each other without having to comb through multiple social media platforms.
